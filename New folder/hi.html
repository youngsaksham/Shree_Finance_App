Greetings To Everyone I Am Saksham Agrawal Of Class 8th From Sarangi Madhya Pradesh And I Am Here With My App Shree Finance App   Its a loan calculator and it is for my silicon velley project  rIsiding in a village i saw a lot of people taking loan from institutional and as well as non institutional sources amejechrm out of this loans are from agriculture sector but we can say that one thing that comes with loan is EMI pament and they do on time which is not paid in the late fee charges and also it change credit score of person and lower the creadit score the lower chanse of taking loan  so a need of cunsumer freandly appariance when annyone can keep a record of a loan profile from a investor or a borrower     point of veiw              talking about the use  of application you just need to open the app select if you want to use the app application as a investor or a borrower sign up if you are a new customer by providing your email address and a six digit or more digit password and by conforming it         now loggin is your critential on loggin you will find the loan calculator where all you need to do is type the amount of loan interest decided by the investor and the boorower and there payment period       now simply click on calculate button and it will show the EMI to be paid by the borrower or to be taken by an investor also some time some mistake we set a amount like a type error so you can just click on the reset button and refil the ditails if you put some wrong details or if you want to calculate for other purpus        so by this way you can reset the details and creates the new loan structure also we have an option to add a borrower or an investor in the application and the application maintains the record of the amount to be paid or to be received by any person respectivily we also provide the user of the application the option of global chat which can be used for interraction with global investor or borrower and also to chat that with you specific investor or borrower in term of loan amount to be taken or to be granted         so right now we can say that my application is a pakag of inclusion where you can just know the amount of EMI that you need to pay you can chat on a global level but what are the thing the fetures that i am thinking to include in a future corse of time is like if you pay a certain amount of EMI and you go on that so it your amount is selected but what if the EMI is unable to be paid at a particular point of time in that case a late fee charge so we are planning to add that large late fee option            so you can just enter the amount or the percentage of the late fee charge them after that the amount from next month or accordingly        the application will set the amount in such a way that you will need to pay the EMI accordingly inclusive of your late fee charge on loan how like that              so we have planning to do this future cource of time and we think that it is needed because not everyone is able to pay all the loan amount on time there are many defaultiers in india as well as on globsaly level        so these are some of the things that must be included to make this app work and this are some of the things which a person as an individual is unable to do  so if there is any application where you just need to type persentage of amount and you will get the EMI you will get the late fees to be paid to do charged paid    so it would be easy for the investor as well as for the borrower           and now i beleve that the application is gonna change the life of many of the persons around the world as because all we talk about a littracy but no one actually cares about finance litteracy for many of us not even know the term financial literecy means          so here my application brings you the financial literacy as it healps you to keep the record of your finances of the loan that are taken to be paid by the borrower and an investor so if you keep record of all the amount that you need to pay or the amount that you or need to take from a borrower then it will be easy for you as from an investor point of veiw       if we has a record that a person is going to given a certain amount of money at a particular date then he can plan his investments accordingly and grow at a rapid base and in the same pose of a borrower if he knows that he needs to pay a certain amount of money at a particular date then he will somehow manage the funds till that date so that he dont need to pay some extra charges and his finances will be maintain by him so like wise if everyone is able to maintain their finances if everyone is able to maintain their money than the financy littracy will be their and everyone will be financially stable           thank you
